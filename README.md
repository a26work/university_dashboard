# University Dashboard Module

## Overview

The **University Dashboard** is a custom Odoo 17 OWL (Odoo Web Library) component designed to present key statistics and visual analytics for a university management system. It provides a high-level overview of various academic entities such as colleges, departments, programs, and courses, as well as user demographics and academic performance through KPIs and interactive charts.
